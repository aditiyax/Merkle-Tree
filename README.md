# Merkle Tree in Solidity

This project implements a Merkle Tree in Solidity, enabling efficient and secure verification of data integrity on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Efficient Verification**: Allows for efficient proof of inclusion or exclusion.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures the integrity of data stored on the blockchain.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for large data sets due to logarithmic verification time.
- **Security**: Utilizes cryptographic hashing for secure data verification.

## What is a Merkle Tree ?
Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. 
It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of itâ€™s child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth and are as far left as possible. 
It maintains data integrity and uses hash functions for this purpose. 

## Project Overview

The Merkle Tree implementation is written in Solidity and can be deployed on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. It includes functionalities to construct a Merkle Tree, generate Merkle Proofs, and verify the proofs. This implementation is useful for applications requiring secure and efficient data verification, such as decentralized storage or blockchain-based audit logs.

## Usage

To use the Merkle Tree implementation, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether to deploy the contract and interact with it. The contract can be deployed using tools like Truffle or Remix, and interactions can be performed through a web3 interface or directly from the Ethereum console.
